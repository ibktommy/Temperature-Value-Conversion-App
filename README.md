# Temperature-Value-Conversion-App
A Javascript enabled web app that converts a given temperature value from one unit to another

This web app is a basic Javascript project that coverts a specified temperature value from one unit to another.<br><br>
One can input anyone of "Celsius", "Fahrenheit" or "kelvin" value and such value will automatically be converted to the other units.<br><br>
The conversion is performed using Javascript.<br><br>
As the user inputs a number value, such value is passed and stored as a variable in the JS code and passed into the specified formula in the JS code.<br>
The formula then calculates the value for the other units and the answer is displayed all along.<br><br>

This is one of the basic JS project I have done.
